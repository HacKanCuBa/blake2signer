                has no practical size limit. It defaults to the class name.
            digest_size (optional): Size of output signature (digest) in bytes
                (defaults to 16 bytes). The minimum size is enforced to 16 bytes.
            hasher (optional): Hash function to use: blake2b (default), blake2s
                or blake3.
            deterministic (optional): Define if signatures are deterministic or
                non-deterministic (default). Non-deterministic sigs are preferred,
                and achieved through the use of a random salt. For deterministic
                sigs, no salt is used: this means that for the same payload, the

                Note that this assumes that the serializer and compressor are
                always deterministic.
            separator (optional): Character to separate the signature and the

            encoder (optional): Encoder class to use (defaults to a Base64 URL

                serializer).

                compressor).
            compression_flag (optional): Character to mark the payload as compressed.
                It must not belong to the encoder alphabet and be ASCII (defaults
                to ".").
            compression_ratio (optional): Desired minimal compression ratio, between
                0 and below 100 (defaults to 5). It is used to calculate when
                to consider a payload sufficiently compressed to detect detrimental
