# Inspirations

This library was born as the need to simply sign some data structure to store it in a cookie securely. I had been using *itsdangerous* for that but this time I wanted something simpler and uncomplicated, so I wrote a couple of lines and got it working using native [BLAKE2 in keyed hashing mode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#blake2); of course that to achieve it I read *Django's signer* and *itsdangerous* source code **a lot**.

I then published that as a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/HacKanCuBa/b93864a1ed41746b3d75f80eb09de109) for others (and me) to use in a copy-and-paste fashion. I proceeded to add a few features, tests, and the like and eventually asked myself: *why not create an actual package?*. The more I edited the Gist, the more I believed it could actually be more useful as a package, and to be actually installed in projects, just like other excellent libs such as [itsdangerous](https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com), [Django's signer](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/signing), [pypaseto](https://github.com/rlittlefield/pypaseto), [pyjwt](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt), etc.

Again, if *itsdangerous* exists and can use BLAKE2 as hashing algorithm, why write something from scratch? I think that the main reasons for me were simplicity, better defaults, and an easier to use API. I wanted something that one would import and use pretty much as-is, and of course I expected that to be secure and performant.

Therefore, **blake2signer** as a package was born.
