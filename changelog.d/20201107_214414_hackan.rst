Removed
-------

- Remove `flake8-annotations-complexity` because it is failing in Python 3.9 (there's a bug report already filled for this and a new release should come soon).

Added
-----

- Create jobs to tests this lib under different Python versions.
- Add usage examples in classes docstrings.

Changed
-------

- Renamed enum `Hashers_` to `HasherChoice` and subclass it from string.
- Update dev dependencies.

Fixed
-----

- Bring back Python 3.7 compatibility by removing the use of TypedDict which was unneeded.
