Removed
-------

- Force bytes was removed from low-level functions because I can't help myself to see that there.

Changed
-------

- The signature is base64 encoded.
- The timestamp is base64 encoded.
- The salt is generated and used as base64 data to avoid needing to decode it when checking the signature.
- Use a symbol to separate composite signature from timestamp and data.
- Verify the signature before decoding.
- Blake2Serializer was renamed to Blake2SerializerSigner because of reasons.
